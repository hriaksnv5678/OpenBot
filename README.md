# OpenBot
A open source Minecraft bot based on the Mineflayer API

## How it Works
OpenBot v0.1 uses the [Mineflayer API](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) and the [Blessed Console UI Framework](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) to be able to control actions of a Minecraft bot ingame, on servers.

## I need more information!
This Github Readme **Won't Contain** Much about the features, and how to get started and so on. Instead, these will be posted on our [Documentation](https://docs.openbot.cf)
