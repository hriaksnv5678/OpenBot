# OpenBot
A open source Minecraft bot based on the Mineflayer API

## How it Works
OpenBot v0.1 uses Node.JS, the [Mineflayer API](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer), WebSockets and other features to bring you a bueatiful and simple to use GUi to manage automatic Minecrfat bots, that can do things from AFKing to raiding to farming! And best of all, it's open source! No more paying to use a bot, or struggling with code!

## I need more information!
This Github Readme **Won't Contain** Much about the features, and how to get started and so on. Instead, these will be posted on our [Documentation](https://docs.openbot.cf)
