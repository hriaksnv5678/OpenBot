# OpenBot
A open source Minecraft bot based on the Mineflayer API

## How it Works
OpenBot v0.1 uses the [Mineflayer API](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer) and the [Blessed Console UI Framework](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) to be able to control actions of a Minecraft bot ingame, on servers.

## How do I get started with OpenBot?
OpenBot v0.1 is coming soon. When it does, there will be chat control and basic movement controls. For the v1 Release, we hope to make a web GUI, so you can have multiple instances of bots.
